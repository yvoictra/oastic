As long as you don’t register your server at Valve, you will only be able to connect to the server via LAN, not via the Internet. It will never be an official server played on. To make your server ready for the internet, you have to go on with the next step (you can terminate the actual running session with an CTRL+C combination).\nMake your server To register your CS:GO server at Valve and make it ready for internet play, you have to register the server directly at Valve. To do so, visit the following link: Steam Server management. Login with your steam credentials (if you haven’t already) and enter the number 730 as the App ID in the first text box. The second text box can be filled with whatever you want. It’s just a comment field. For e.g. if you have more than one server you could write down the hostname here so that you can always directly see which token belongs to which server. Click on Create to get your Token:\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll need to use this token as YOUR_GLST variable in the launch script in the next steps.\nConfigure the server First step is to create a server.cfg config file with your preferred text editor. In my case, vi:\ncsgo|venice:~$ vi ~/Steam/csgo-ds/csgo/cfg/server.cfg And then insert this configuration with the correct values:\nhostname \u0026quot;The name of your CS:GO server\u0026quot; sv_password \u0026quot;server_password\u0026quot; sv_timeout 60 rcon_password \u0026quot;rcon_password\u0026quot; mp_autoteambalance 1 mp_limitteams 1 writeid writeip  sv_password is the password users will need to enter to join the server. rcon_password is the RCON password, which is used to remotely control the game server from within the game.  After this, we have to create a startup script for CS:GO with the following snippet. Name the file startcsgo.sh and save it to your csgo user’s home directory. Set the value of the YOUR_GSLT variable at the top to be your game server login token. Set the value of the CSGO_INSTALL_LOCATION variable at the top according to the table below.\ncsgo|venice:~$ vi ~/startcsgo.sh And the insert:\n#!/bin/sh YOUR_GSLT= YOUR_PUBLIC_IP= CSGO_INSTALL_LOCATION=/home/csgo/Steam/csgo-ds cd $CSGO_INSTALL_LOCATION screen -S \u0026quot;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Server\u0026quot; ./srcds_run -game csgo +ip $YOUR_PUBLIC_IP -usercon +game_type 0 +game_mode 1 +mapgroup mg_hostage +map de_mirage +sv_setsteamaccount $YOUR_GSLT -net_port_try 1 Make the script executable:\ncsgo|venice:~$ chmod +x ~/startcsgo.sh Launch the server csgo|venice:~$ cd ~ \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ./startcsgo.sh Join the game  Launch Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Once launched, go to Play and click Browse Community Servers. Click on the Favorites tab and then click Add a Server at the bottom. Type in the IP address of your Linode and click Add this address to favorites. You’ll see your new Counter-Strike: Global Offensive server. Click Connect at the bottom right and start fragging away.
