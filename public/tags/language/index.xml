      <description>Connect with SSH to your machine and execute next command
sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales  After this, you will see a list of languages and countries. You have to select with space bar the language and country you need. In my case, as I live in Spain, I have selected es_ES.UTF-8. It is recommended to choose UTF-8 version.
Finally, Ubuntu will ask you to select the default language to use in the operating system.</description>
