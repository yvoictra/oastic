SSH is the acronym of Secure Shell. It is an encrypted protocol to remotely administrate a server and it is widely used in the Internet.

An SSH server can authenticate clients using diferent methods. The most basic is the password authentication, however it is not the most secure.

SSH Key authentication is more secure than password authentication, so I recommend you to use this method in your servers.

How to create an SSH key in Linux
---------------------------------

To create SSH Keys in Linux we have to use the tool `ssh-keygen`, which is included in the OpenSSH package. By default, it will create a 2048 bit RSA key, but I recommend to use 4096 bit RSA key.

The tool will ask for an passphrase. I recommend you to use it, because it adds an extra layer of security.

```
username@host:~$ ssh-keygen -b 4096
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/username/.ssh/id\_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id\_rsa
Your public key has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id\_rsa.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:g3QQCuT97ggNoRjVORbVK7jjCr7SpvCARz10n0vaxAg username@host
The key's randomart image is:
+---\[RSA 4096\]----+
| .+..++o         |
| o o=. ..        |
|. o.Eoo ..       |
|.o +.=.\*..       |
|o o o.+.S        |
|.. ooo = o       |
|=.oâ€¦o o          |
|+=o..o           |
|o=+.. .          |
+----\[SHA256\]-----+
```

Once created, you will have 2 new files, the public key (`/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) and the private key (`/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa`). Now you have to install de public key in the server in which
